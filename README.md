# Process vegetable signs
This hacky script converts HEIC images of vegetable signs to SVG files. 
It resizes to 400mm x 300 mm, then vectorizes them. The result is a black and white image.
The images still need manual processing after, but this process is significantly simplified.

It does this by using ImageMagick and Potrace which you would need to install on your computer.
